In this project, I analyzed *Global Equity Returns* which is made of an unbalanced panel of monthly equity log total excess returns for 36 countries.

Various investigations have been lead. Among others: 

-On average, do more volatile markets have higher average log returns? And higher average returns?

-Creation and analysis of an **Equal-Weighted Portfolio**.

-Creation and analysis of an **Equal-Volatility Portfolio** (a form of risk parity).

-The impact of a **Momentum** Portfolio strategy.

-A newly created strategy involving, a **long-short Portfolio based on logCAPE ratio and Momentum**.
